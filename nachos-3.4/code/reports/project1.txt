Project 1 Report

Exercise 1
We change the definition of threadtest(int) as well as the declaration,
and modify the function of simplethread(). The new threadtest(int)
creates N new threads, all of which execute 5 times a loop defined in
simplethread(). In this loop, a thread reads and writes a shared
variable. After its first reading and just before it writes the variable
back with one increment, the thread yiels the CPU control to other
threads. After it finishing the writing, it yiels again before the
final reading.

The Yield operation cause context switching between multiple
threads. One thread overwrites the modification to shared variable
made by other threads, which resulting in incorrect increment of the
shared variable.

Without any syrnchronization technique, when we run Threadtest(4)
creating threads numbered by 0,1,2,3,4, at the end, these threads
update the shared variable to 5.
